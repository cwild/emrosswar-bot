# ==== A short guide on internationalisation ====

# I was interested enough to play with this but not to convert the entire codebase.

# The gettext module automatically uses the loaded locale files. The environment variable
# can be set and tested such as:
/usr/bin/env LANGUAGE=de_DE.UTF-8 python bot.py -h


# How do we find translations?
find . -iname "*.py" | xargs xgettext --from-code=UTF-8 -o emrosswar-bot.po -p resources/locale

# Do the necessary translations and then compile the file
msgfmt -o emrosswar-bot.mo emrosswar-bot.po

# Put the compiled messages into a special directory structure. eg:
resources/locale/LC_MESSAGES/en_GB/emrosswar-bot.mo
